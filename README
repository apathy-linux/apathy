apathy
======
apathy is a toy linux thing that i actually use daily, built from scratch for
the sake of having something to do.

musl is utilized as the libc implementation for the toolery bits, coupled with a
standalone llvm suite, without anything gcc or binutils in it. the reason behind
this is not to be a gnu hating contrarian but due to firefox being the fastest
compiling modern standards compliant browser and it having a hard dependency on
rust and clang, therefore llvm. i see no point in having two things serving the
same purpose.

busybox applets are used where possible, though without creating a scenario
where the user experience is crippled solely to achieve "minimalism". if it
works, it works.

the package building and management is done all by hand and all the packages are
built using in-house recipes. the list and the build order of all built packages
are kept in a parsable plain text file. the directory listing of a package is
saved by doing a destdir install prior to installing it to the rootfs.

the init is in-house and written in posix shell. services are collected into a
single file as shell functions. `rc` does the talking for booting up and going
down. it features basic failproofing to save from catastrophies, device tailored
init configuration and a cli tool to manually start and stop services. like the
init systems of old times, there's no watchdoggery going on therefore no auto
restarting exists. all things considered, all are intellgent and mature enough
for my use cases.

on top of the init configuration, each machine running apathy also has a device
and acpi profile to aid with using all of the features of the machine in an
automated manner.

because this whole thing is intended for my use only, this repo does not contain
an image to boot from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack. objectively speaking,
you would not want to use it anyway.

=====================
├ dir/             -> base system configuration files.
├ init/            -> in-house init system written in posix shell, using sinit
│                     with some ubase programs with {b,u,w}tmp disabled.
├ misc/            -> miscellaneous notes and images.
├ pkg/
│ ├ recipes/       -> in-house build recipes for a variety of software.
│ ├ trees/         -> directory listings for installed and removed programs.
│ └ packages-*.txt -> parsable lists of "packages" installed in each machine 
│                     running apathy.
└ utils/
  ├ bin/           -> utilities used in apathy, written in posix shell.
  └ files/         -> files complementing the utilities and shells.
