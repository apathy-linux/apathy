apathy
======
apathy is a toy linux thing that i actually use daily, built from scratch for
the sake of having something to do.

in the toolchain, musl is utilized as the libc implementation, coupled with a
completely standalone llvm suite without anything gcc or binutils in it. the
reason behind this is not to be a gnu hating contrarian but due to firefox
being the fastest compiling modern standards compliant browser and it having a
hard dependency on rust and clang, therefore llvm. i see no point in having two
things serving the same purpose.

for small shell utilities like coreutils, busybox applets are used where
possible, though without creating a scenario where the user experience is
crippled solely to achieve "minimalism". if it works, it works.

the package building and management is done all by hand and all the packages are
built using in-house recipes. the list and the build order of all built packages
are kept in a "database" (a text file). the directory listing of a package is
saved by doing a destdir install prior to installing it to the rootfs.

the init is also in-house and written in posix shell. the services are collected
into a single file as shell functions and `rc` does the talking it has basic
failproofing to save from catastrophies, device specific init configuration and
a cli tool to manually start and stop services. all are intelligent and mature
enough for my use cases.

because this whole thing is intended for my use only, this repo does not contain
an image to boot from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack. objectively speaking,
you would not want to use it anyway.

basic repository tree
=====================
├ dir/             -> base system configuration files.
├ init/            -> in-house init system written in posix shell, using sinit
│                     with some ubase programs with {b,u,w}tmp disabled.
├ misc/            -> miscellaneous notes and images.
├ pkg/
│ ├ recipes/       -> in-house build recipes for a variety of software.
│ ├ trees/         -> directory listings for installed and removed programs.
│ └ packages-*.txt -> parsable lists of "packages" installed in each machine 
│                     running apathy.
└ utils/
  ├ bin/           -> utilities used in apathy, written in posix shell.
  └ files/         -> files complementing the utilities and shells.
