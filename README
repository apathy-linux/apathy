apathy
======
apathy is an independent operating system featuring linux in its core.

musl is utilized as the libc implementation of choice, coupled with a standalone
llvm suite without anything gcc or binutils in it. firefox being the fastest
modern standards compliant browser and it having a hard-dependency on clang and
rust makes llvm a must. i see no point in having two things serving the same
purpose when clang, libc++ and the rest are mature enough to build anything i
use.

busybox applets are used where possible if they are not creating a scenario
where the user experience is crippled solely to achieve minimalism. if it works,
it works.

the package building and management is done all by hand. all the packages are
built using homegrown recipes. the list and the build order of all built
packages are kept in a parsable plain text file. the directory listing of a
package is saved by doing a destdir install prior to the installation to the
rootfs occurs, then used when removing or updating the package.

the init of the system is written in posix shell. services reside in a single
file in the format of shell functions. `init` is a shell script that traps USR1
and INT, and does the talking for booting up and going down. there's basic fool-
proofing mechanisms developed through the proccess of dogfooding. each machine
that runs a build of apathy has a tailored init configuration. there also exists
`ainitmgr`, a shell script to manually start|stop|restart services. as shell is
hairy enough on its own, no watchdoggery is going on.

alongside the init configuration, for every machine that runs apathy has a
device and acpi profile to aid with using all the features of the machine in an
automated manner.

as this whole thing is intended for my use only, this repo does not contain an
image to boot from or a stage{1..4} tarball to unpack.

basic repository tree
=====================
├ dir/             -> base system configuration files.
├ init/[1]         -> in-house init system written in posix shell, complemented
│                     with getty, ctrlaltdel, halt, killall5, login and respawn
│                     from ubase with {b,u,w}tmp functionality removed.
├ landfill/[2]     -> modified versions of dwm, st and dmenu cobbled together
│                     under a single meson project as an attempt to create a
│                     desktop environment type of thing.
├ misc/            -> miscellaneous notes and images.
├ pkg/
│ ├ recipes/       -> in-house build recipes for a variety of software.
│ ├ trees/         -> directory listings for installed and removed programs.
│ └ packages-*.txt -> parsable lists of "packages" installed in each machine
│                     running apathy.
└ utils/
  ├ bin/           -> utilities used in apathy, written in posix shell.
  └ files/         -> files complementing the utilities and shells.
